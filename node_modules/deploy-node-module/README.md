# deploy-node-module
Provides a command that pushes and publishes a Node.js module in one go. The command does the following steps:

1. Increase the version in `package.json` and add a git tag via `npm version`.
2. Push the git repository.
3. Push the git tags.
4. Publish the module via `npm publish`.

```bash
$ npm run deploy [major/minor/patch]
```

## Installation
Install the module via NPM install:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev deploy-node-module
```

## Usage
It makes sense to define a custom `deploy` script in your `package.json`:
```bash
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "deploy-node-module"
  }
}
```
Then the command can be used the following way:
```bash
$ npm run deploy [major/minor/patch]
```
If no parameter is given, `patch` is used.
